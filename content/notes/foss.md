## Free and Open-Source (FOSS)
### Free

> Not *necessarily* free as in no-cost, but [free as in freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html): free to use, study, modify, improve, redistribute, etc.
### Open-Source

> A project's source code and/or design is publicly available
## Why should I care? 
### 1. Transparency
Transparency is inherent to open-source software. The source code is available for all to see, which means the author's claims about what the software does can be validated. No funny business.
### 2. Security
Given the transparent nature of FOSS, there are more eyes looking for potential vulnerabilities. Yes, some of these eyes will belong to malicious actors, but a far greater number will belong to people maintaining the software; hence, it's more likely that such vulnerabilities will be patched before they're exploited, whereas vulnerabilities in closed-source software may only be known to the vendor (who may not patch the vulnerabilities immediately due to a false sense of security) and the malicious actors.
Open-source software also resists the insertion of malicious or undesirable features, since all updates are also publicly available and verified via communal code review.
### 3. Privacy
FOSS fosters privacy, once again, due to its transparency. Furthermore, FOSS is often designed to be privacy-respecting first and foremost. 
### 4. Liberty
You can do what you want with the software without any special terms and conditions. Free software won't claim a right to whatever you create with the software.
