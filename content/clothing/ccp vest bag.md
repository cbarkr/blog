Carol Christian Poell is an enigma among enigmas. In his own words (in the few interviews he has ever given), he creates patterns that "seek to annul the body"[^interview][^interview2], rather than compliment it, and conducts shows in locations that are "not very welcoming"[^domus] and, at times, deter attendance. CCP's enigmata also stems from his unorthodox methods: such as the development of novel manufacturing processes to create experimental threads and fibres, as well as unique dyeing and tanning techniques that are applied to already constructed garments[^grailed]. This has established him as one of fashion's most "researched designers"[^grailed]. 

One branch of this research led to a certain US military life vest which later served as inspiration for what would become one of the designer's most iconic pieces. This life vest, formally named "Life Preserver, Vest, Work
Type, Unicellular Plastic", is defined in specification MIL-L-17653[^spec]. Though CCP's renditions differ in a number of ways (such as fabric, closures, use of vertical-zipping pockets, and length of back panel), the silhouette is still an obvious inspiration. For reference, see the two side-by-side below:

One note about the MIL-L-17653: the spec was published in 1959, but wasn't withdrawn until 2002. That is, the spec was valid for 43 years. And during that time, it was revised a number of times. Hence, examples of MIL-L-17653 vests online may differ from the one shown.

I recently acquired a late coast guard model MIL-L-17653, which was originally bright orange, uses snaps instead of zippers, and does not include all of the required markings as designated in the original specification. I have since object dyed it (twice!) using Rit's jet black dye, so it now closely resembles the example shown above.
