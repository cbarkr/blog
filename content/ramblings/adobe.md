title: Adobe and FOSS

I think it's fair to say that most people don't actually read the Terms of Service (TOS) before clicking "accept". I know I certainly used to skip them. Why spend hours reviewing pages upon pages of nauseating (but mostly inconsequential) legal jargon when I could be doing something productive? 
It turns out that sitting down and reviewing the TOS can be productive (to some). You might discover that the service you already pay to use has now claimed rights over the works you create with that service. At least, this is the case with the latest updates to Adobe's TOS, which has sparked outrage among creatives and professionals. Adobe [responded](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/06/06/clarification-adobe-terms-of-use) with a blog post clarifying the new terms, but it does not explain much. 
## Adobe's TOS
At the time of writing (June, 10th, 2024),  [Adobe's Terms of Service](https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html) (TOS) contain the following (troublesome) clauses:
### The Changes
#### Privacy
> 2.2 **Our Access to Your Content.** We may access, view, or listen to your Content (defined in section 4.1 (Content) below) through both automated and manual methods, but only in limited ways, and only as permitted by law. For example, in order to provide the Services and Software, we may need to access, view, or listen to your Content to (A) respond to Feedback or support requests; (B) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, legal, or technical issues; and (C) enforce the Terms, as further set forth in Section 4.1 below. Our automated systems may analyze your Content and Creative Cloud Customer Fonts (defined in section 3.10 (Creative Cloud Customer Fonts) below) using techniques such as machine learning in order to improve our Services and Software and the user experience. Information on how Adobe uses machine learning can be found here: [http://www.adobe.com/go/machine_learning](http://www.adobe.com/go/machine_learning).

Translation: "We can snoop through your files and do with them as we please. Maybe we'll train our ML models on them."
#### Your Content
> 4.2 **Licenses to Your Content.** Solely for the purposes of operating or improving the Services and Software, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free sublicensable, license, to use, reproduce, publicly display, distribute, modify, create derivative works based on, publicly perform, and translate the Content. For example, we may sublicense our right to the Content to our service providers or to other users to allow the Services and Software to operate as intended, such as enabling you to share photos with others. Separately, section 4.6 (Feedback) below covers any Feedback that you provide to us.

Translation: "We can and will do whatever we want with your creations, and there's nothing you can do about it."
#### Dispute Resolution, Class Action Waiver, Arbitration Agreement
> 14.2 **No Class Actions. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Nonetheless, if any portion of this class action waiver is deemed unenforceable or invalid as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.**

Translation: "We deny you the right to hold us accountable for our unethical practices"

Note/Question: Is this legally binding? It's like saying "I cannot be held accountable for what I'm about to do", \*then proceeds to do something bad\*
### The Implications
The latest updates to Adobe's TOS state that they claim a right to *your* work. With this right, [as others have pointed out](https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/06/change-to-adobe-terms-amp-conditions/) online, Adobe can access your works (manually (i.e. with human eyes on said work)), which could violate Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA). They also hold the right to train their machine learning (ML) models with your data in the name of "improving the Services" (which, let's be real, can be just about anything). 
## Free and Open Source (FOSS)
### Free
> Not *necessarily* free as in no-cost, but [free as in freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html): free to use, study, modify, improve, redistribute, etc.
### Open Source
> The source code is publicly available
### Why should I care? 
- Transparency
- Security
- Privacy
- Liberty
